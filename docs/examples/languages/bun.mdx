## Running the pre-built Bun pipeline directly

Run the following command to run the pre-built [Bun Pipeline](https://github.com/fluent-ci-templates/bun-pipeline) without having to initialize a project:

import Tabs from "@theme/Tabs";
import TabItem from "@theme/TabItem";
import CodeBlock from "@theme/CodeBlock";

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="dagger" label="Dagger">
    <CodeBlock language="bash">
      {`fluentci run bun test`}
    </CodeBlock>
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="wasm" label="Wasm">
    <CodeBlock language="bash">
      {`fluentci run --wasm bun test`}

</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Add Bun Pipeline to your project

Run the following command to add Bun pipeline to your project:

```bash
fluentci init -t bun
```

This will create a `.fluentci` directory in your project, feel free to customize the pipeline for your needs.
You can then run the following command to start the pipeline:

```bash
fluentci run .
```

Or simply:

```bash
fluentci
```

## Jobs

| Job  | Description    |
| ---- | -------------- |
| test | Run your tests |

## Programmatic usage

You can also use this pipeline programmatically:

```ts
import { test } from "jsr:@fluentci/bun";

await test();
```
