## Running the pre-built Fastlane pipeline directly

Run the following command to run the pre-built [Fastlane pipeline](https://github.com/fluent-ci-templates/fastlane-pipeline) without having to initialize a project:

import Tabs from "@theme/Tabs";
import TabItem from "@theme/TabItem";
import CodeBlock from "@theme/CodeBlock";

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="dagger" label="Dagger">
    <CodeBlock language="bash">
      {`fluentci run fastlane execLane buildRelease`}
    </CodeBlock>
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="wasm" label="Wasm">
    <CodeBlock language="bash">
      {`fluentci run --wasm fastlane execLane buildRelease`}

</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Add Fastlane Pipeline to your project

Run the following command to add Fastlane pipeline to your project:

```bash
fluentci init -t fastlane
```

This will create a `.fluentci` directory in your project, feel free to customize the pipeline for your needs.
You can then run the following command to start the pipeline:

```bash
fluentci run .
```

## Jobs
