## Running the pre-built Spin pipeline directly

Run the following command to run the pre-built [Spin pipeline](https://github.com/fluent-ci-templates/spin-pipeline) without having to initialize a project:

```bash
fluentci run spin_pipeline
```

## Add Spin Pipeline to your project

Run the following command to add a Spin pipeline to your project:

import Tabs from "@theme/Tabs";
import TabItem from "@theme/TabItem";
import CodeBlock from "@theme/CodeBlock";

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="dagger" label="Dagger">
    <CodeBlock language="bash">
      {`fluentci run spin build`}
    </CodeBlock>
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="wasm" label="Wasm">
    <CodeBlock language="bash">
      {`fluentci run --wasm spin build`}

</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

This will create a `.fluentci` directory in your project, feel free to customize the pipeline for your needs.
You can then run the following command to start the pipeline:

```bash
fluentci run .
```
