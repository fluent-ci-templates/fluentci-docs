# Using Pre-Built Pipelines

Fluent CI comes with a set of pre-built pipelines written in TypeScript that you can use to build, test, and deploy your code. These pipelines are designed to be used with the most common CI/CD workflows and can be used as-is or customized to fit your needs.

## What is a Pipeline?

A Pipeline is a set of steps that are executed in a specific order. Each step can be configured to run a specific command, and the output of each step is passed to the next step in the pipeline.

## How to Use a Pipeline

To use a pipeline, you need to browse the list of available pipelines and select the one that best fits your needs.

Example:

```bash
fluentci run android_pipeline
```
