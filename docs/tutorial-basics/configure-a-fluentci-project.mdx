title: Create a new FluentCI Project
---

## Get the example application

The example application is a simple React application that displays a "Hello from FluentCI!" welcome page. Clone the repository using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/fluentci-io/hello-fluentci
cd hello-fluentci
```

## Initialize a FluentCI project using the `init` command

To initialize a FluentCI project, run the following command:

```bash
fluentci init -t bun --wasm
```

This will create a `.fluentci` directory in your project. The `--wasm` flag is used to enable WebAssembly (Wasm) support in the pipeline. Feel free to customize the pipeline for your needs.

## Initialize a FluentCI project using `fluentci studio`

You can also use the `fluentci studio` command to initialize a project. This command will guide you through the process of setting up a FluentCI project.

```bash
fluentci studio
```

import StartStudio from "./screenshots/start-studio.png";

<img src={StartStudio} alt="start studio" />

This will start the FluentCI Studio on `http://locahost:6076`, where you can select the template you want to use for your project and customize it as needed.

## Run the pipeline

You can run the pipeline using the following command:

```bash
fluentci run . run build
fluentci run . bunx serve dist
```

Or by clicking the "Run" button in the FluentCI Studio.

import Studio from "./screenshots/studio.png";

<div style={{ border: "1px solid rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.2)", marginBottom: 30 }}>
  <img src={Studio} alt="fluentci studio" />
</div>

This will build the project and serve the output using the Bunx server.
Note that you don't need to pre-install any dependencies, as FluentCI will automatically install them for you.
